              When Tahm Kench drags you down into the abyss, it feels like being swallowed alive by the river itself—cold, dark, and suffocating. The moment his slimy tongue coils around you, there's a sickening slurp as you're yanked beneath the water’s surface, plunging into an all-encompassing darkness. The water is thick, more like brackish sludge than any river, clinging to your skin and filling your mouth with the taste of rot and decay. It’s colder than death, a bone-numbing chill that digs in like icy claws and steals the breath from your lungs. The weight of the water presses in on all sides, squeezing tighter and tighter, crushing any remnants of light or hope from your mind.

As you descend deeper, the sounds of the world above fade away, replaced by an eerie silence that stretches endlessly in all directions. Then, you hear it—the low rumble of Tahm’s voice, vibrating through the water like distant thunder. It’s not words you hear, but a guttural hunger, a deep, mocking growl that resonates with each heartbeat, echoing your own helplessness. His laughter rolls through the darkness, thick and malicious, as if the river itself is alive and mocking your feeble struggle.

You try to swim upward, but the water resists, its murky depths pulling you down like a thousand grasping hands. Your limbs feel heavy and numb, as if the darkness is slowly eating away at your very strength. Then, you see it—a faint glow beneath you, a sickly yellow light that grows brighter as you sink further. It illuminates a maw lined with needle-sharp teeth, each one glistening like jagged rocks waiting to tear you apart. The light comes from his eyes, wide and greedy, watching you with the same cruel amusement as a predator toying with its prey.

His mouth opens wider, a cavernous abyss that seems to stretch on forever, and as you’re drawn closer, you feel a pull that is more than physical—a gnawing sensation in your mind, a hollowing out of your very soul. You’re not just drowning; you’re being devoured, piece by piece, as your memories, hopes, and fears are sucked away into that ravenous void. The darkness is absolute now, wrapping around you like a shroud, and just before the maw snaps shut, you catch one last glimpse of his mocking grin—so wide, so full of hunger. And then, with a wet, gurgling swallow, you are gone, lost in the belly of the beast, where the echoes of those who came before you cry out from the depths, only to fade into silence once more. 

In his mouth, you are more than lost — you are consumed.
