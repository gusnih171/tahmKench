              Being devoured by Tahm Kench is a waking nightmare, a plunge into darkness and despair from which there is no escape. As his jaws open wide, you see nothing but a cavernous maw lined with rows of needle-sharp teeth, slick with saliva and glowing faintly with a sickly green light. The air grows thick and fetid, carrying the reek of rot and brine. His breath washes over you, warm and moist, stinking of stale river water and the sour tang of decay. It is a stench that clings to your very soul, filling your lungs with the suffocating odor of death.

The moment his mouth snaps shut, the world outside disappears, swallowed in an instant. Inside, the darkness is complete, a smothering void where no light can reach. The walls of his throat are slick and pulsating, squeezing you down into the depths like a living tunnel. It’s like being pulled into a black, writhing pit, where the flesh around you is cold and clammy, like the skin of a drowned corpse. The muscles contract and writhe, crushing you from all sides as they drag you further down, deeper into the beast’s gullet. There is no sense of direction, no way to tell which way is up or down—only the relentless pull toward the pit of his stomach.

As you slide deeper, the air grows thicker, humid with the moisture of his breath, and the slimy walls seem to close in tighter with every inch. The further you go, the stronger the stench becomes, until it feels like it’s burning its way through your senses, numbing you to everything but the overwhelming dread. You feel your skin prickling as if the very air were alive, filled with a thousand tiny, biting things that gnaw at your flesh. There’s an acidic burn that starts to creep across your skin, seeping into every cut, every pore, as though the very essence of his hunger is eating away at you, bit by bit.

Then, you fall. There’s a sudden drop as you’re expelled from the tightness of his throat, tumbling into the pit of his stomach. The impact is wet and heavy, landing in a pool of foul-smelling sludge that bubbles and churns. It’s not water, not really—more like a viscous, caustic soup of bile and partially digested remains. It clings to your skin, searing with a corrosive burn that eats away at your flesh and clothes alike. The liquid is thick and suffocating, and as you struggle to keep your head above its surface, you can feel it pulling at you, trying to drag you under.

The walls of the stomach are alive, pulsating with an awful, rhythmic motion, as though the entire chamber were breathing. You can hear the muffled cries and whispers of others who have been swallowed before you, their voices twisted and distorted, as if echoing from far away. The acidic pool churns, and you feel the unmistakable sensation of something brushing against your leg—a rotting limb, perhaps, or the bone of some unfortunate soul who came before you, now stripped of flesh and form. 

Here, in the belly of the River King, time loses all meaning. There is only darkness, the stench of decay, and the unending sensation of being slowly, inexorably dissolved. The world above is a distant memory, your struggles futile, your cries swallowed by the churning depths. You can feel yourself fading, your strength seeping away, as his hunger consumes you from the inside out. And as you begin to lose the fight, you realize that this is what he craves most of all—not just your flesh, but your despair, your hopelessness. 

In the end, when there is nothing left of you but a fading echo, Tahm Kench will let out a satisfied burp, and the river will flow on, as if you never existed at all.
